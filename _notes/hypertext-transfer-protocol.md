The [[Hypertext]] Transfer [[Protocol]] (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the [[World Wide Web]], where [[hypertext]] documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a [[web browser]].
